# flashcards
I decided to make some multiplication flash cards for my kids :)
The focus was to create a light weight app that can be accessible with limted bandwidth.
Animaition and sound is added to keep young children engaged.  
This game shows 9 being mulitplied from 0 through 12, but additional numbers can be added as desired.
